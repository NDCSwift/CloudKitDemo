# üì¶ SwiftData + CloudKit Sync Demo

A minimal reference project demonstrating how to use **SwiftData** with **CloudKit** for seamless syncing of user data across iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices.  
This example includes a simple `Entry` model, a basic UI for creating and displaying entries, and all the core configuration needed for CloudKit-backed persistence.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- `@Model`-based SwiftData setup
- CloudKit-backed persistence with `.modelContainer(for:)`
- Basic UI to:
  - Add new entries (Name + Description)
  - Display saved entries
  - Sync entries across devices logged into the same iCloud account
- Example of `photoAssets: [Data]?` to handle images with CloudKit

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Requirements
- Xcode 16+
- iOS 18+ (or macOS 15+, iPadOS 18+)
- A physical device signed into iCloud (‚ö†Ô∏è CloudKit does **not** sync in the Simulator)
- An active Apple Developer Account

---

### 2. Enable iCloud + CloudKit
1. In **Xcode**, select your app target ‚Üí **Signing & Capabilities**.  
2. Add the **iCloud** capability.  
3. Enable **CloudKit**.  
4. Ensure the container name matches your Bundle ID exactly, e.g.:  iCloud.com.yourcompany.appname
5. Confirm the container exists in the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Errors:**
- *Invalid Bundle ID for container* ‚Üí container and bundle don‚Äôt match.  
- *Bad Container* ‚Üí added in Xcode but not in Developer Portal.  
- *Error 134060 (Schema mismatch)* ‚Üí remove app, clean build, rerun.

### 3. The Data Model
```swift
@Model
final class Entry {
 var id: UUID = UUID()
 var title: String = ""
 var details: String = ""
 var photoAssets: [Data]? // For CloudKit sync
}
```

### 4. Usage

The HomeView provides:
	‚Ä¢	TextFields for creating new entries.
	‚Ä¢	A list of all saved entries (auto-synced across devices).
	‚Ä¢	Real-time sync powered by SwiftData + CloudKit.

Run the app on two physical devices signed into the same iCloud account to see instant syncing.

Rules for CloudKit compatibility:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ All non-optional properties must have defaults.
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Do not use @Attribute(.unique) (causes sync crashes).

  Use the CloudKit Dashboard to inspect:
	‚Ä¢	Your container
	‚Ä¢	Development Database
	‚Ä¢	Auto-generated CD_Entry record type

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
	‚Ä¢	This repo does not include entitlements or a configured iCloud container.
You must set these up in your own Apple Developer account to run CloudKit sync successfully.
	‚Ä¢	Schema changes:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Safe: Add new optional/defaulted fields
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Unsafe: Remove or change types (requires migration)
